## Overview

This project simulates a wireless communication system where a message is encoded, transmitted, and decoded using specific signal encoding techniques. The goal is to understand how signal encoding, noise, and bit rate affect the transmission and decoding process. The steps involved are:

1. Encoding a message into a sequence of signals using binary representation.
2. Decoding the received signal by calculating correlation.
3. Simulating noise and studying its impact on decoding accuracy.

## Part 1: Message Encoding

### Objective
Convert a given text message into a binary representation and encode it using a sequence of specific signals for transmission.

### Implementation
1. **Character Mapping**: A matrix `Mapset` maps 32 specific characters to 5-bit binary codes.
2. **Encoding Function**: The `coding_amp` function:
   - Takes the message and transmission speed as inputs.
   - Encodes the binary message into corresponding signals based on the bit rate.

---

## Part 2: Message Decoding

### Objective
Decode the received signal and recover the original message by calculating correlation with predefined signals.

### Implementation
1. **Decoding Function**: The `decoding_amp` function:
   - Takes the encoded signal and transmission speed as inputs.
   - Decodes the message using correlation to compare the received signal with predefined templates.
2. **Thresholding**: Based on the correlation values, decisions are made about the transmitted bits.

## Part 3: Noise and Signal Simulation

### Objective
Simulate noise in the received signal to assess its impact on message decoding.

### Implementation
1. **Noise Generation**: Use MATLABâ€™s `randn` function to add Gaussian noise with a mean of zero and varying variance.
2. **Power Control**: Modify the signal power and simulate the impact of different noise levels on decoding accuracy.
3. **Bit Rate and Noise Sensitivity**: Study the trade-off between transmission speed (bit rate) and noise resistance.
