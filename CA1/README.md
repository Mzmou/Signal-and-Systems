## Overview
The project demonstrates foundational MATLAB techniques with practical applications in signal processing:
- Linear regression analysis
- Signal convolution and correlation
- Noise simulation
- Audio file speed modification (doubling or halving the playback speed)

## Features
- **Regression Analysis**: Calculate coefficients for alpha and beta using the loss function and derive their values through differentiation.
- **Signal Transformation**: Perform signal convolution, triangular waveform generation, and correlation analysis.
- **Noise Addition**: Simulate and analyze noisy signals to measure approximation accuracy.
- **Audio Speed Modification**: 
  - Double playback speed by removing alternate data points.
  - Halve playback speed using interpolation.

## Installation
1. Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Signal-and-Systems.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the `CA1` folder within the repository:
   ```bash
   cd signal-and-system/CA1
   ```
4. Open the MATLAB application and navigate to this folder.

## Usage
1. Open the desired `.m` file in MATLAB.
2. Run the script using the MATLAB editor or the command window.
3. For audio processing:
   - Use the provided scripts to load an audio file(put the file in the directory and change the name in the script)..
   - Adjust playback speed by running the respective sections for doubling or halving the speed.
4. Output graphs and results will be displayed in the MATLAB figure window or command console.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB (tested on version R2021a and later)
- Audio file formats supported by MATLAB (e.g., `.wav`)

## Contribution
This project is open for anyone to use, modify, or enhance. Contributions to improve functionality, optimize scripts, or expand features are welcome.
